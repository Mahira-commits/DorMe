# DorMe

DorMe is an application to be used by dorm residents to exchange services. Every user logs in with an email and starts with a total of 10 points; points can be used to employ other users in the services that they are offering. In addition, users can add services that they want, such that other users can see these wants and offer services based on the demand.
